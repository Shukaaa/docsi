## What is Docsi?

- 📄 Docsi is a static site generator for documentation. <br/>
- ✍️ It is written in JS and uses Markdown as its markup language. <br/>
- 👶 It is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend. <br/>
- 🎨 It already comes with a default theme, but you can easily change it. <br/>
- ⚡ You can also run and build it super fast, because it uses Vite and Grunt. <br/>
