# Docsi Docs

> Welcome to the Docsi Docs! 🎉🎉🎉

## What is Docsi?

- 📄 Docsi is a static site generator for documentation. <br/>
- ✍️ It is written in JS and uses Markdown as its markup language. <br/>
- 👶 It is designed to be simple to use and easy to extend. <br/>
- 🎨 It already comes with a default theme, but you can easily change it. <br/>
- ⚡ You can also run and build it superfast, because it uses Vite and Grunt. <br/>

## Installation

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @docsi/cli
```
Then run the following command :

```bash
docsi new my-docs
```

After a few questions, the CLI will generate a new Docsi project in the `my-docs` folder.
